## Preparation
We will be utilizing a PostgreSQL 11 server for storing and retrieving data and Docker for hosting it. To do this, first install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/.


Once installed, run the following commands in your terminal:
1. To run the server:
`docker run -d --name ht_pg_server -v ht_dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 54320:5432 postgres:11`
2. Check the logs to see if it is running:
`docker logs -f ht_pg_server`
3. Create the database:
`docker exec -it ht_pg_server psql -U postgres -c "create database ht_db"`
4. Modify paths in the config.py script and run it to load the csv data into the DB. Then populate the database:
`python etl.py`

## Interacting with the DB
In the first part of the home task you will be required to utilize the DB to query the data. If you are unfamiliar with PostgreSQL, we recommend installing DBeaver (Mac, Windows, Linux) or Postico.

For Postico visit: https://eggerapps.at/postico/. 
Once installed, open Postico and:
1. click 'New Favorite'
2. enter the following:
- Nickname: revolut_ht
- Host: localhost
- Port: 54320
- User: postgres
- Database: ht_db
3. click 'Done' and 'Connect' 
and you should be able to see the data you just loaded to the database.

	- **user_id**: string uniquely identifying the user
	- **birth_year**: integer corresponding to the user’s birth year
	- **country**: two letter string corresponding to the user’s country of residence
	- **city**: two string corresponding to the user’s city of residence

	- **num_contacts**:	integer corresponding to the number of contacts the user has on Revolut
	- **num_referrals**: integer corresponding to the number of users referred by the selected user
	- **num_successful_referrals**: integer corresponding to the number of users successfully referred by the selected user (successfully means users who have actually installed the app and are able to use the product)
3. notifications.csv

## Hints & Tips
1. Engineering practice is a strong component of ML Engineer role. Anything you include in the `code/` sub-directory should be nearly production grade.
2. Presentation, creativity and the ability to dive deep into the problem space is a strong component of the Data Scientist role. Your presentation should be one you could comfortably present to a team of technical and non-technical employees.
3. Communicating your thought process is also important, we care a lot about the auditability & reproducibility of research/analysis for both Scientists and Engineers. 
4. Data visualisation and storytelling are important (don’t hesitate to use external packages)
5. Backup assumptions with data
6. All analysis should be accompanied with explanations (models, coeffiecients, tests and values)
7. Keep your code clean and comment it
